                Upon cooking the meal, the user can press a button to be redirected to the main activity ready for next use.
                In addition, further functionality like a <i>timer</i> to keep track of cooking times, and <i>nutrition limit</i> are provided to make the experience as convenient
                and bespoke for the user.
